# JAVAFX_FIGHTING_GAME
This is the project done for OOP course. This is a fighting game written from scratch using JAVAFX library.
No external library was used for the game engine, rather builtin animation of javafx was used to create the game engine.
The game has all the required assets in the project folder.

In order to run the game, just use javafx sdk. 

## Important Point
The game has multiplayer support, that was implemented from scratch with java sockets and threads. However the multiplayer system will only work between two computers.
There is no option to choose the ip address on the gui. So in order to run this game, the specific ip address of two computers is to be set in the Main.java file's two function 
namely CreateGameCharacters() and CreateHero().

With all set, the game is good to go. Enjoy!!!
